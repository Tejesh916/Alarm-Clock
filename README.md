# Alarm Clock Web Application

This project is a simple and interactive **Alarm Clock Web Application** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to set alarms with different notification sounds and provides a clean, user-friendly interface.

The application applies **fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts for efficient time handling, alarm scheduling, and event management. The project focuses on organizing logic effectively while maintaining smooth user interaction.

## 🔔 Features
- Set and manage alarms in real time
- Multiple alarm sounds (Birds, River, Guitar)
- Clean and responsive user interface
- Efficient time comparison and alarm triggering
- Lightweight and browser-based application

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  

## 🎵 Notification Sounds
The application includes three royalty-free MP3 notification sounds:
- **Birds Chirping** – Soft and calm morning alarm  
- **River Flowing** – Relaxing ambient notification  
- **Guitar Instrumental** – Musical and pleasant alert
